<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

While doing some hackathons, we definitely understood that if we were to work on projects needing such technologies, it was just time-consuming to create the API over and over again. After the [Hack In The Woods V2](http://hackinthewoods.be), this boilerplate was the next objective to step forwards to our goal : build fast and smart things that help the world and the living!

Here's why you should use this:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a C# back-end solution from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:


### Built With
You will find herebelow the frameworks and dependencies used by this solution:
* [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)

* [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore)
* [Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Versioning.ApiExplorer](https://github.com/microsoft/aspnet-api-versioning)
